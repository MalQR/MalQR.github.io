# MalQR

## About
**MalQR** is a collection of *malicious* QR codes and barcodes you can use to test the security of your scanners. It gives you the ability to conduct such tests with *easiness*: you just need to have a smartphone, a tablet or a laptop with an internet connection and browse [MalQR.shielder.it](http://malqr.shielder.it "MalQR") to have a large collection of common payloads.

Currently it includes these codes standards:
- [QR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)
- [Data Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix)
- [Aztec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code)
- [Code 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_128)

This project is maintained by [**Shielder**](https://shielder.it "Shielder") from an idea of [smaury](https://twitter.com/smaury92 "smaury").
